## TODO
* add semantics to grammar
  - semantics are defined on Prodcution?
    - For lexical rule, the semantic attachment is semantic representation(or constant function)
    - For compositional rule, the semantic attachment is a function which takes the semantics of the children as inputs and returns the semantic for the parent
